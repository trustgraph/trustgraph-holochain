TrustGraph::Holochain is a Rust library, intended to allow for [Hololchain](https://www.holochain.org) developers to easily use the [Trust Graph](https://github.com/trustgraph/trustgraph) protocol in their Happs.

_TrustGraph::Holochain¬†is a very young codebase; **expect limited functionality**, and don‚Äôt use it in production just yet -- but do come collaborate and play as we develop it!_

## Prerequisites

- rust >= 1.56

## Install

In your `Cargo.toml`:

```rs
hc_zome_trust_atom = {git = "https://github.com/trustgraph/trustgraph-holochain.git", rev="v1.2.3", package = "hc_zome_trust_atom"}
```

Replace `v1.2.3` with the tag corresponding to the version you want. See the list of [available tags](https://github.com/trustgraph/trustgraph-holochain/tags).

HDK version correspondence:

- TrustGraph::Holochain `v0.0.1` works with `hdk` version `0.0.116`
- TrustGraph::Holochain `v0.0.2` works with `hdk` version `0.0.116`
- TrustGraph::Holochain `v0.0.3` works with `hdk` version `0.0.116`
- TrustGraph::Holochain `v0.0.4` works with `hdk` version `0.0.116`
- TrustGraph::Holochain `v0.0.5` works with `hdk` version `0.0.116`
- TrustGraph::Holochain `v0.0.6` works with `hdk` version `0.0.116`
- TrustGraph::Holochain `v0.0.7` works with `hdk` version `0.0.125`

## Usage

### TrustAtom Creation

```rs
pub struct TrustAtomInput {
  pub target: EntryHash,
  pub prefix: Option<String>,
  pub content: Option<String>,
  pub value: Option<String>,
  pub extra: Option<BTreeMap<String, String>>,
}

#[hdk_extern]
pub fn create_trust_atom(input: TrustAtomInput) -> ExternResult<TrustAtom> {
    // ...
}
```

### TrustAtom Query

```rs
pub struct QueryInput {
  pub source: Option<EntryHash>,
  pub target: Option<EntryHash>,
  pub prefix: Option<String>,
  pub content_full: Option<String>,
  pub content_starts_with: Option<String>,
  pub value_starts_with: Option<String>,
}

#[hdk_extern]
pub fn query(input: QueryInput) -> ExternResult<Vec<TrustAtom>> {
    // ...
}

```

### TrustAtom

Client-facing representation of a Trust Atom (this is what is returned to client from a `query`)

```rs
pub struct TrustAtom {
  pub source: String,
  pub target: String,
  pub source_entry_hash: EntryHashB64,
  pub target_entry_hash: EntryHashB64,
  pub content: Option<String>,
  pub value: Option<String>,
  pub extra: Option<BTreeMap<String, String>>,
}
```

For more detailed usage, see also the tests: https://github.com/trustgraph/trustgraph-holochain/blob/main/zomes/hc_zome_trust_atom/tests/trust_atom_tests.rs

## Data format

We encode TrustAtoms as links, with the following components:

1. Holochain Link `base` == TrustAtom `source` - one of:
   - creating agent (`AgentPubKeyB64`)
   - TrustGraph (`EntryHashB64`)
1. Holochain Link `target` == TrustAtom `target` - entity being rated/reviewed/etc - one of:
   - `EntryHashB64`
   - `AgentPubKeyB64`
1. Holochain Link `tag`\* (max 999 bytes) - formatted as UTF-8 string

- TrustAtom header bytes: `[0xC5][0xA6]` (which together comprise the unicode character `≈¶`) (required)
- Direction byte:
  - `[0x21][0x92]` (unicode `‚Üí`) means: HC target = TA target
  - `[0x21][0xA9]` (unicode `‚Ü©`) means: HC target = TA source
- TrustAtom `content` - semantic info (eg sushi) - max 900 bytes
- Separator: null byte `[0x00]`
- TrustAtom `value` - rating ( `"-0.999999999"` to `"0.999999999"`) - max 12 chars
- Separator: null byte `[0x00]`
- Random 9 characters for bucketing purposes
- Separator: null byte `[0x00]`
- Canonical data including additional attributes - `EntryHashB64`
  - Entry contains attributes formatted in: `BTreeMap<String, String>`
  - You will find full content here; if content exceeds link tag limts it ends with `‚Ä¶` as a hint
  - If value is 1.0, we use "0.999999999" in link tag, but 1.0 here
  - Entry hash is a sring version of EntryHashB64 for debugging purposes, not raw bytes

\*This format is designed to allow us to encode trust atoms as Holochain links, and search them by their tags. Holochain can search for all links _starting_ with a given set of bytes (characters).

```

## Roadmap

- [x] Create TrustAtoms as paired Holochain links
- [x] Fetch TrustAtoms by content leading bytes
- [x] Fetch TrustAtoms by content and value
- [ ] Roll up a TrustGraph by crawling TrustAtoms (2 levels deep)
- [ ] Integration into holochain example projects, eg [Clutter](https://github.com/artbrock/clutter)

## Dev

If you're new to holochain dev, start here: <https://developer.holochain.org/install>. Then, from a terminal in the root of this repo:

```
nix-shell
```

Then within nix shell:

```
bin/run test             # rust tests
bin/run test_watch       # rust tests with watch

bin/run clippy           # rust linter
bin/run clippy_watch     # rust linter with watch

bin/run clean            # reset to clean repo state; removes all gitignored files
```

Or to run all checks:

```
bin/run checks
```

When you have commits that you are ready to push, to run checks and push only if checks are all green:

```
bin/run shipit
```
